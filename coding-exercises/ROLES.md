# Roles
There are two roles for Guardian staff conducting a coding exercise interview. The calendar invite sent by HR will include who is performing each role.

## Chaperone
Responsible for collecting the candidate from reception and bringing them to the interviewer's desk.

After 45 minutes, the chaperone should briefly visit the interviewer's desk to aid as a time check.

After the hour is complete, the chaperone should collect the candidate and take them back to reception.

## Interviewer
Responsible for explaining and conducting the coding exercise stage of the interview process.

After the 45 minute time check, it is usually a good idea to begin to wrap up. This could include pseudo-coding any remaining tasks, refactoring discussions or answering any questions the candidate may have about the process or role.

Once the hour is complete and the chaperone has collected the candidate, the interviewer should write up notes based on the [assessment criteria](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pyr6pDMvisGAYPCOAAS1YDIrA_GXvCE4YUc3c-vk0H4/edit#gid=0) and make a recommendation to HR on next steps.
